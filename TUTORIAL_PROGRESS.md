# CI/CD Tutorial Progress

## What We've Accomplished ✅

### 1. Project Setup
- Created a .NET 8 Web API practice project
- Added unit tests and integration tests
- Fixed Program class accessibility for testing
- All 5 tests passing locally

### 2. GitHub Repository Setup
- Created GitHub repo: `JaggyG/WindowmakerV3-CICD-Practice`
- Learned about Personal Access Tokens (PAT) with `workflow` scope
- Successfully pushed code to GitHub

### 3. Basic CI Pipeline
- Created `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
- Pipeline runs on push/PR to main branch
- Automated: restore → build → test → upload artifacts
- **Runtime: 27 seconds** (normal for CI environment)

### 4. Key Learnings
- GitHub disabled password auth - use PAT instead
- `workflow` scope required for GitHub Actions files
- CI environment is clean/isolated (slower but reliable)
- Actions tab shows pipeline execution

### 5. Code Coverage Implementation
- Added `coverlet.msbuild` package to test project
- Updated CI workflow with coverage collection
- Added coverage report generation with ReportGenerator
- Added coverage summary to workflow output
- Created coverage badge in README
- **Coverage artifacts**: HTML reports + Cobertura XML

## Current State
- **Repository**: https://github.com/JaggyG/WindowmakerV3-CICD-Practice
- **CI Status**: ✅ Enhanced pipeline with coverage
- **Tests**: 5/5 passing with coverage reporting
- **Ready for**: Code quality checks

## Next Steps (When We Resume)

### Phase 2: Advanced CI Features
1. **Code Coverage Reports**
   - Add coverage collection to tests
   - Upload to Codecov or similar
   - Set coverage thresholds

2. **Code Quality Checks**
   - Add `dotnet format` for code formatting
   - Add security vulnerability scanning
   - Add dependency audit

3. **Multi-Environment Testing**
   - Test on Windows/Linux/macOS
   - Test multiple .NET versions
   - Add integration test database

### Phase 3: Deployment Pipeline
1. **Staging Deployment**
   - Deploy to test environment
   - Run smoke tests
   - Manual approval gates

2. **Production Deployment**
   - Blue/green deployment
   - Rollback capabilities
   - Health checks

### Phase 4: Apply to WindowmakerV3
1. **Adapt for Real Project**
   - Multi-project solution
   - Database migrations
   - VB.NET + C# mixed codebase
   - IIS deployment

2. **Advanced Workflows**
   - Feature branch workflows
   - Release management
   - Automated versioning

## Commands to Remember

### Local Development

## Files Created/Modified
- `src/TestApi/Program.cs` - Added public Program class
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` - Basic CI pipeline
- `tests/TestApi.Tests/FailingTest.cs` - Fixed to pass
- Various project files and dependencies
