This is a practice project to learn CI/CD concepts before implementing them in WindowmakerV3.

## Project Structure

## Features

- âœ… Basic CI pipeline with GitHub Actions
- âœ… Automated testing on push/PR
- âœ… Code coverage reporting
- ðŸš§ Code quality checks (coming soon)
- ðŸš§ Multi-environment testing (coming soon)
- ðŸš§ Deployment pipeline (coming soon)

## Running Locally

```bash
# Build the project
dotnet build

# Run tests
dotnet test

# Run tests with coverage
dotnet test --collect:"XPlat Code Coverage"
```

## CI/CD Pipeline

The CI pipeline runs automatically on:
- Push to `main` or `develop` branches
- Pull requests to `main` branch

### Pipeline Steps

1. **Setup**: Configure .NET 8.0 environment
2. **Restore**: Download NuGet packages
3. **Build**: Compile in Release mode
4. **Test**: Run all unit and integration tests with coverage
5. **Coverage**: Generate coverage reports
6. **Artifacts**: Upload build outputs and coverage reports
